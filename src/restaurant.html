                        Welcome to farmers table where we pride ourselves in serving fresh local meats and produce!
                        We take simple ingredients and elevate them with modern techniques to produce elevated dishes! 
                        We specialize in modern french cuisine to highlight seasonal produce.
                        Although our menu is constantly changing we also serve staples year round such as beef stew 
                        and steak frites.
